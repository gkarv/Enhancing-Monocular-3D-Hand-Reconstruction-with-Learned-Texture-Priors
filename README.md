## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
This work revisits the role of **texture** in monocular 3D hand reconstruction, treating it not only as a tool for photorealism but as a **dense, spatially grounded supervisory signal** that enhances pose and shape estimation.  

We propose a lightweight, transformer-based **texture module** that consolidates sparse UVâ€“RGB observations into a full texture prior. Integrated into existing pipelines (e.g., HaMeR), our approach delivers measurable accuracy and realism gains, particularly in **occluded and egocentric scenarios**, without adding any test-time overhead.

## ðŸš€ Key Contributions  
- Introduces the **first unified framework** for learning texture priors from sparse, monocular observations.  
- **Transformer-based module** with pixel-level attention for coherent texture reconstruction.  
- **Weakly-supervised training** using differentiable rendering â€” no manual annotations required.  
- Improves state-of-the-art monocular hand reconstruction benchmarks (e.g., **+2.7% PCK** on occluded hands).

## ðŸ”§ Setup Pretrained Weights

1. **Download the weights**  
   ðŸ‘‰ [texture_supervised_hamer_weights](http://cvrlcode.ics.forth.gr/web_share/gkarv/texture_supervised_hamer_weights.ckpt)
   These weights have been retrained with our textureâ€“supervised framework, incorporating the learned texture priors described in the paper.

2. **Place the file** into the following directory (after cloning and setting up the [HaMeR repo](https://github.com/geopavlakos/hamer)): hamer/_DATA/hamer_ckpts/checkpoints/

2. **Update [the init file](https://github.com/geopavlakos/hamer/blob/091de2a07b5414a2f9373d2bec368b8c979883b6/hamer/models/__init__.py#L31) with hamer.ckpt -> texture_supervised_hamer_weights.ckpt
